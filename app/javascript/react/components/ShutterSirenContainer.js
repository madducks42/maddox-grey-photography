              Much to her chagrin, Maddox isn&apos;t able to escape the cement jungle
              full-time so while in the city she focuses on a different type of
              photography; telling the story of the Boston burlesque scene which
              is full of creative, queer, and body-positive folks from all
              backgrounds.</p>
